#### Prospective students:
I am actively looking for enthusiastic postdoctoral researchers, PhD candidates, and master's students passionate about delving into applied machine learning and computer vision research. Proficiency in Python programming is essential, along with expertise in machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Additionally, a solid foundation in optimization, analysis, and fundamental statistics would be advantageous. Interested students please [apply here](https://forms.gle/9jzFC42BKVRm7jxKA)

#### Industrial collaborations:
I have had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed senior researchers and engineers such as [Julian Yarkony](https://sites.google.com/site/julianyarkonymachinelearning/) (Laminaar), [Vibhav Vineet](https://vibhav-vineet.github.io/) (Microsoft Research), [Rudra Chakraborty](https://rudra1988.github.io/) (Lawrence Livermore), [Kihyuk Sohn](https://sites.google.com/site/kihyuksml/) (Google Deepmind), [Jinsung Yoon](https://sites.google.com/view/jinsungyoon/) (Google Cloud), [Anima Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anima-singh-b36ba62b/) (Google Deepmind), and [Xinyang Yi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r0c4bz4AAAAJ&hl=en) (Google Deepmind) in the past.

I am keenly interested in fostering collaborations with industry researchers and engineers. I am open to exploring opportunities for a part-time engagement, perhaps with a one-day-a-week commitment, or collaborating on a joint publication. I am also willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) if required.
